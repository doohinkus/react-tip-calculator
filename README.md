This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tip Calculator
I wrote this calculator with React and tested with Jest. This is my first TDD project--where tests were written before the code. As a result, I learned more about writing tests than I did about React. That was the point.

This project uses Bootstrap for CSS styling. Here is a link to live version: (https://wakeful-quince.surge.sh/)
